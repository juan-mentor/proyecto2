### What I learned

he aprendido como funciona realmente los backgrounds, que propiedades tengo que utilizar y sobre todo a posicionar mis imÃ¡genes de fondo, de manera sencilla y sin complicarme en el cÃ³digo. (tendencia a la que soy bastante propenso)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
